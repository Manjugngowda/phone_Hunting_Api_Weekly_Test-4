**Phone Hunting API - Weekly Test 4**
This project is a simple yet powerful web application for browsing and filtering phone models based on user preferences. It simulates a real-world phone search feature using a mock API.

**Project Description**
The Phone Hunting app allows users to efficiently search and filter various mobile phones by brand, price, and other specifications. It showcases how an interactive user experience can be created using client-side technologies and simulated backend data.

**Features**
Quick Search: Users can type in a search query to instantly find relevant phone models.
Filtering Options: Easily narrow down results by brand, price range, and other criteria.
Responsive Layout: The application adapts smoothly across different screen sizes and devices.
Dynamic Content: The phone list is updated dynamically based on user inputs without page reloads.

**Technology Stack**
**HTML5**: For the app’s structure and content.
**CSS**: For styling and responsive design.
**JavaScript (ES6)**: For dynamic updates, user interaction handling, and API data management.
**Mock API**: A JSON-based mock API serves as the data source for the phone listings.

**How to Run the Project Clone the Repository:**
**bash Copy code**
git clone https://github.com/manjugngowda/phone_Hunting_Api_Weekly_Test-4.git
Navigate to the Project Directory:

**bash
Copy code**
cd phone_Hunting_Api_Weekly_Test-4
Launch the Application:
Open the index.html file in your preferred browser.

**File Structure**
index.html: The primary HTML file for the app’s layout and structure.
style.css: Contains all styles for the app’s appearance and responsiveness.
script.js: The core logic for search, filtering, and API interactions is implemented here.

**How It Works**
Search Functionality: Users enter keywords in the search bar, and matching results are displayed instantly.
Filter Mechanism: Users can select filters to refine the phone list, like choosing specific brands or setting a price range.
Real-time Updates: The app automatically updates the displayed phone list as users interact with the search and filter options.

**Potential Enhancements**
Implementing more advanced filtering, like by screen size, battery life, or features.
Integrating a real backend API for fetching live phone data.
Adding sorting options, like by price (low to high or high to low).
Enhancing UI/UX for better accessibility and user experience.

**Conclusion**
This project serves as a good demonstration of creating a responsive and dynamic phone hunting tool using fundamental web technologies.
